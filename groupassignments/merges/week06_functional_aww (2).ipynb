    "**Description:** Purpose of this notebook is to create a \"functional\" notebook using commute mode of travel to work and commute time while demonstrating use of using a function and a loop. After seeing others midterm projects and some brutal feedback, I'm going to try and better intergrate our data and give a fuller picute of public transit in LA.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notes for self to advance project:**\n",
    "* Overlay heavy rail and light rail stops\n",
    "* Provide more accurate description of the areas through a spatial join\n",
    "* Compare with race/ethnicity and income data; we should create some side by side comparisons of transit use and race/eth and income\n",
    "* Query \"high\" trasnit tracts, cross reference with income and race/eth, potential to add spatial dimension of LA neighborhoods\n",
    "* Availability of cars in households\n",
    "* Bring a shaprer focus to Central LA and the San Fernando Valley"

    "**The Story (Restating previous told story to establish firm baseline):** Maps show a concentration of high transit use in Central, Eastside, Northeast, and Southeast \"regions\" of Los Angeles. This is primarily bus ridership. There is some rail, but it remains relatively low proportion of people. There is a \"moderate\" amount of transit users on the Westside and in the San Fernando Valley. These areas will need further exploration in order to explain their higher relative use of transit compared to the rest of LA. Feedback from the midterm suggests to look at the Metro Orange BRT, Metro Red Line, other busways, and Metrolink commuter rails. I will need to compare to race/eth and income to these areas plus the agglomeration of heavy transit use in Central LA. I'm expecting there to be strong correlations with race/eth and income with transit use from what I remember.\n",
    "In terms of the \"controls\" (the non transit variables), a few patterns have emerged. Those walking to work seem to be relegated to the Central LA, and on the Westside between Santa Monica and Beverly Hills (very close to the UCLA campus). Those working from home tend to live heavily in the Valley, though there are pockets on the northern periphery of the Central LA region.\n",

    "This is a new perspective for the narrative of transit ridership in LA, even if this information might not extraordinarily new. My purpose of looking at commute time was to try and gain some insights on where people in LA work in hopes to see if there was a component of mismatching between housing and jobs. There are of course a variety of other factors that go into the where people work and live; that being said, it might reveal some preferences in mode of transit. At the very least, it gives a more complete picture of transit ridership patterns in LA.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above maps, there are essentially two groups: the total time of commute to give an overall pattern of commute time in LA and those only using public transit. The distribution for LA overall seems evenly distributed minus a few exceptions. Without looking at any housing data, this could suggest a jobs rich and housing shortage balance for the region. Housing shortages are not a new issue and it should be cautioned that inferences on solely commute time might not be indicative of the full picture. More research is needed on this scope. In terms of public transit commute times, a couple patterns are emerging:\n",
    "* Public transit that takes 29 minutes or less are a clear minority of workers in LA. That doesn't mean ridership is zero, as there is a significant portion of workers that use transit where it takes 29 minutes or less. \n",
    "* The vast majority is traveling 30 minutes or longer with a significant number of workers traveling 60 minutes or longer. This is present in almost every region. \n",
    "* It's apparent from the transit maps above for the San Fernando Valley that if workers are using transit, most are traveling 45 minutes or longer with the biggest proportion traveling 60 minutes or longer. There are some other census tracts where residents have less travel time, which would suggest access to a more centrally located transit location or a more localized job.  \n",
    "* Questions remain on the distance workers have to travel and the kinds of work. Inquiries into this may be more descriptive in nature, but could still be illuminating. \n",
    "* I would like to produce an isochrone map, though I'm unsure of how effective it will be with transit ridership. It might at the least give an indication of the distance traveled for workers. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For further exploration:\n",
    "* Overlay heavy rail and light rail stops\n",
    "* Provide more accurate description of the areas through a spatial join\n",
    "* Compare with race/ethnicity and income data"
