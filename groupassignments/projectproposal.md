# An introduction of your research question
How do Los Angeles neighborhoods compare in accessibility and mobility? This question is the cornerstone of intended research and ultimately, we believe this query will lead to deeper questions centering on LA's transit system, development practices, and Angelenos' quality of life. Through the axis of accessibility and mobility, we seek to grasp how different neighborhoods and demographic compositions experience daily life in their own neighborhood and the broader city. It's important for us as planners, and LA residents overall, to understand how these spatial structures enable Angelenos to live full, quality lives. 

# A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
We will focus on three neighborhoods in Los Angeles as case studies. We will choose places that are both geographically and socioeconomically diverse, including interstate and transit access, race, and income. Space and time are important for this project because it unscores whether or not individuals are connected to basic needs, and the inequitable distribution of those connections. Time plays a role in helping to understand how the transportation system has evolved, and what that evolution means for connectivity, access, and mobility. 

# A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use - BEN
1. US Census (ACS) 
2. LA Times Neighborhood dataset (boundaries)
3. LA Metro station area maps
4. Bureau of Transportation Statistics user data by mode

# A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project - BEN
Analysis: Neighborhood, race, ethnicity, gender - how does this population experience transportation? Do they have access? Mode share by neighborhood, transit access (bus v. train), highway access, food desert, medical care, pollution, etc.

# A concluding paragraph of what insights you expect to gain from your research - ANDREW
-How people with different income levels experience LA's transportation network differently
-Disproportionate access to "efficient" transport (what does efficient mean?) 
-Historical context as to why these inequities exist 
-Correlation btwn high access transit areas and amenities, development
This is all important for upward socioeconomic mobility and wellbeing...
