# Our research question and why it matters
How do Los Angeles neighborhoods compare in accessibility and mobility? This question is the cornerstone of intended research and ultimately, we believe this query will lead to deeper questions centering on LA's transit system, development practices, and Angelenos' quality of life. Through the axis of accessibility and mobility, we seek to grasp how different neighborhoods and demographic compositions experience daily life in their own neighborhood and the broader city. It's important for us as planners, and LA residents overall, to understand how these spatial structures impact Angelenosâ€™ lives. 

# A description of the spatial scope (e.g. Boyle Heights or Hong Kong), and why space and/or time matters for your project
We will focus on three neighborhoods in Los Angeles as case studies. We will choose places that are both geographically and socioeconomically diverse, including interstate and transit access, race, and income. Space and time are important for this project because it unscores whether or not individuals are connected to basic needs, and the inequitable distribution of those connections. Time plays a role in helping to understand how the transportation system has evolved, and what that evolution means for connectivity, access, and mobility. 

# A preliminary but definitive description of data sources (at least two) that you will use
1. US Census (ACS): The ACS is an annual survey that provides summary statistics, including race, income, and household size, among other things, on the U.S. population. 
2. LA Times Neighborhood dataset (boundaries): This dataset from the LA Times provides a clear definition of neighborhood boundaries, which is necessary for our interrogation of certain spaces. 
3. LA Metro station area maps: This dataset is a shape file of the location of all LA Metro rapid transit stations.
4. Bureau of Transportation Statistics user data by mode: BTS provides a number of datasets, some updated annually, some monthly, on the modal split of transportation users in geographic regions.

# A scope that explains the intended analysis and resulting visualizations for your project 
Our analysis aims to focus on the inersections of race, ethnicity, and gender, and their geographies, and how this impacts a resient's transportation experience. We will define terms like access and mobility, and interrogate this inequitable distribution across Los Angeles. We will show this with a number of maps, graphs, and charts, all of which will be easily accessible to non-technical audiences for broad consumption. 

# Insights we expect to gain from our research
From our research, we hope to gain insights on how accessibility and mobility shape LA neighborhoods and resident wellbeing. We are curious how the intersection of demographic compositions and neighborhood location can radically change how residents experience daily life. Where inequities exist, we hope to understand how spatial patterns combined with historical context created uneven development and disproportionate access.
