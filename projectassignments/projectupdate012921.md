# Week 4 Group Assignment Update 

## LA Neighborhood Transit Mobility
[Intial Project Proposal](https://github.com/bfb508/up206a_finalproject/blob/main/projectassignments/projectproposal.md)

## Group Roles:
As we still explore the dynamics of LA neighborhood transit, we are sharing the task data exploration. Once our datasets are prepared, we will assign specific sets of analysis for each person e.g., Andrew looking at transit mobility across neighborhoods, and Ben looking at driver commute times across neighborhoods.

**Andrew Williams, Transit Expert/Deep Data Diver (TBD):** Andrew has prepared a dataset on the means of transportation to work for the city of LA, as well as a shape file on rapid bus routes in LA. This week he is adding all of LA Metro's transit shapefiles to our collected data. He will continue to supplement any gaps in his data. 

**Ben Bressette, Resident Expert/USDOT Analyst (TBD):** Ben has prepared datasets on race, language spoken at home, and geographic mobility of residents of city of LA. This week Ben is cleaning some of the data that he found. He will continue to supplement any gaps in his data.  

## Status update:
We are still curious in our exploration but are worried that our project is too broad in scope. We have been able to more appropriately define our spatial scale, but the time constraint of this being a class project limits the meaningful conclusions we will be able to make. Additionally, we have chosen to not focus on accessibility in terms of access to amenities. Accessibility could play a role within mobility. However, we are choosing to focus on the mobility of residents in LA neighborhoods given current constraints. Further, if we see other factors within neighborhood mobility, we believe we have room to explore them. 

## Data update:
We are continuing to search and add to our datasets. By the start of week five, we will have shapefiles of LA Meto's cleaned and consolidated, and have residential information for LA city census tracts. From this point, our next step is to identify gaps in our existing datasets, supplement them if needed, and then combine them into one dataset for analysis. Further, we need to develop a method to categorize census tracts as part of their larger neighborhoods, to make conclusions about transportation mobility throughout the city. We will do this through the [LA Times Neighborhood Map]( http://maps.latimes.com/neighborhoods/). 

## Concerns: There should be a lot to be concerned about at this phase of the project. List those concerns and classify them as "Major concerns" and/or "Minor concerns."
### Major
1. Data cleaning
2. Preparing different datasets to be accurately compared 
### Medium
1. Time
2. Matching census tracts with defined neighborhood boundaries
### Minor
1. Appropriately applying skills that we're learning that are helpful to our research
2. Merging notebooks
