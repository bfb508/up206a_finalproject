## Research Question
How does transit mobility compare across Los Angeles?

Purpose: We hope to gain insights in how the intersection of race, income, and geographic location can radically impact Angelenos' daily lives. Though mobility is one dimension within transportation that's part of a broader fabric of social determinants, it's important for us as as planners to understand how these spatial reverberate across Los Angeles.
